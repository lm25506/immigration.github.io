 <p style="background-color:pink;font-size:20px"> Hey everyone! We are Carolyn Perez, Lucy Ma,
   Joselyn Ruiz, and Sarah Khoja. We are all part of the Girls Who Code 2019 Summer Immersion Program
   that is helping us develop an interest in Computer Science. In this program we learned the importance
   of understanding technology and how it can impact our daily lives. We made
   this website in order to help people be informed about sometimes-ignored-information
   about immigration. Thank you! </p>
