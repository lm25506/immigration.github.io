      Immigration is the international movement of people into a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess
      citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as Permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take up employment as a
      migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker.
      <br>
      <p> ...... </p>
      <br>
      The United States prides itself on being a nation of immigrants, and the nation has a long history of successfully absorbing people from across the globe.
      The successful integration of immigrants and their children contributes to economic vitality and to a vibrant and ever-changing culture. Americans have
      offered opportunities to immigrants and their children to better themselves and to be fully incorporated into U.S. society, and in exchange immigrants
      have become Americans—embracing an American identity and citizenship, protecting the United States through service in its military, fostering technological
      innovation, harvesting its crops, and enriching everything from the nation’s cuisine to its universities, music, and art. 2015 marked the 50th anniversary
      of the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, which began the most recent period of mass immigration to the United States. This act abolished the restrictive
      quota system of the 1920s and opened up legal immigration to all the countries in the world, helping to set the stage for a dramatic increase in immigration from
      Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. At the same time, it limited the numbers of legal immigrants coming from countries in the Western Hemisphere, thus
      establishing restrictions on immigrants across the U.S. southern border and setting the stage for the rise in undocumented border crossers. Although the Immigration
      Act of 1965 exemplified the progressive ideals of the 1960s, the system it engendered may also hinder some immigrants’ and their descendants’ prospects for integration.
      Today, the 41 million immigrants in the United States represent 13.1 percent of the U.S. population. The U.S.-born children of immigrants, the second generation,
      represent another 37.1 million people, or 12 percent of the population. Thus, together the first and second generations account for one out of four members of the U.S. population. Whether they are successfully integrating is therefore a pressing and important question.

    <p>Thousands of years before Europeans began crossing the vast Atlantic by ship and settling en masse, the first immigrants arrived in North America and the land that would later become the United States. They were Native American ancestors who crossed a narrow spit of land connecting Asia to North America some 20,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age</p>

    <p>By the early 1600s, communities of European immigrants dotted the Eastern seaboard, including the Spanish in Florida, the British in New England and Virginia, the Dutch in New York, and the Swedes in Delaware. Some, including the Pilgrims and Puritans, came for religious freedom. Many sought greater economic opportunities. Still others, including hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans, arrived in America against their will.</p>

  <p>Many of the immigrant children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico are escaping extreme violence, often gang-related and fueled by the drug trade. A 2013 report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees indicated that 63% of the immigrants from El Salvador, 43% of Hondurans, and 32% of Mexicans cited violence in society (mostly gang-related violence) as the reason for leaving. Violence in the home was another strong motivator, with statistics standing at 63% for El Salvador, 24% for Honduras, and 17% for Mexico. "Salvadoran and Honduran children ... come from extremely violent regions where they probably perceive the risk of traveling alone to the U.S. preferable to remaining at home," the report said. Guatemalan children cited deprivation (29%), violence in the home (23%), and violence in society (20%) as reasons for leaving their countries. Children in Honduras also cited poverty as reasons for leaving, while many girls from El Salvador reported fear of both home and gang-related sexual abuse.</p>

  <p>In 2014, one in five births (791,000) in the United States was to an immigrant mother (legal or illegal). Our best estimate is that legal immigrants acounted for 12.4 percent (494,000) of all births, and illegal immigrants accounted for 7.5 percent (297,000). The 297,000 births per year to illegal immigrants is larger than the total number of births in any state other than California and Texas. It is also larger than the total number of births in 16 states plus the District of Columbia, combined.</p>

  	<p>U.S. immigration law is very complex, and there is much confusion as to how it works.
      The Immigration and Naturalization Act, the body of law governing current immigration policy,
      provides for an annual worldwide limit of 675,000 Permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family
      members. Lawful Permanent residency allows a foreign national to work and live lawfully and Permanently
      in the United States. Lawful Permanent residents are eligible to apply for nearly all jobs
      and can remain in the country even if they are unemployed. Each year the United States also
      admits noncitizens on a temporary basis</p>

    <p>Immigration to the United States is based upon the following principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, protecting refugees, and promoting diversity. </p>

    <p>How many visa applications for Permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?</p>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p>In February 2019, the U.S. government was still processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to August 1995, and employment-related visa applications from August 2007. According to data on the petitions submitted to the State Department, there were about 3.8 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) who were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2018, the first time the backlog dropped in recent years.The overwhelming majority of backlogs were family-sponsored applicants (3.7 million, which includes the principal applicant and their immediate family members). About 121,000 were employment-sponsored applicants and their families. Of the overall 3.8 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (314,000), India (299,000), Vietnam and China (with 232,000 each). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful Permanent resident from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimate. USCIS also publishes backlog statistics but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. USCIS data show that close to 395,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date based on the May 2018 Department of State Visa Bulletin. The figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI knowledge, USCIS did not publish backlog statistics on other types of green card applications the agency adjudicates. In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States is likely to be larger than the 3.8 million reported by the State Department (as of November 2018) and 395,000 reported by USCIS (as of May 2018).</p>
